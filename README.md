# mini-yelp-exercise

This was a small exercise as part of the WBS Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp.
The task was to create an Express backend REST API for the frontend crew to use for their Yelp inspired search service.

An example .env file is provided to create the needed variables for the database connection.
